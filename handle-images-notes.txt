First you create an image-handler file in utils whereyou keep all the functions that deal with images within the back app. There we importh "path" library: 

    import path from "path";

So we can use its join() function - the one that brings together parts of a custom URL. Then we use it in the custom getImagePath(imageName) function that provides us with the needed URL.

Then we go back to the routes and create a GET route for images. Inside its params we expect to get :imageName, so we can extract it in the try block and send it to the getImagePath function. The response will be:

    reponse.sendFile(imagePath);

After that - create two new URL's (for server and images) in app-config.

p.s dont forget to add __dirname where needed!
